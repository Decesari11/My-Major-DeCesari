  <h2>Information About a Computer Information Systems Major</h2>

  <p>A computer information systems degree equips you with the skills and knowledge to design, develop, implement, and maintain computer systems and networks.
   Computer information systems professionals are in high demand across all industries, and the field offers a variety of career paths with strong job growth potential.
   In a typical computer information systems program, you could expect to take courses that dive into programming, networking, cybersecurity, database management, systems analysis and design, 
   and business process management.
   <br><br>
   One of the main reaons I choose this major is because I have a genuine passion for cybersecurity. I got a lot of exposure to the field during my time in the military, and I have been
   set on making that my career of choice ever since. In addition to it being something that I enjoy, this field offers a lot of flexibilty with its wide range of career paths.
   This is important to me because if for some reason cyber doesn't work out for me, I can transistion other careers such as software development, networking, or IT project management.
   Overall, I have greatly enjoyed the coursework of my major and I look forward to starting my career in computer information systems.
